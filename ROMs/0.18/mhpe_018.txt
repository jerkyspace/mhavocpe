Release notes for Major Havoc - The Promised End 
v0.18
05/29/2018

**For ROM locations see the document at https://github.com/jessaskey/mhavocpe/blob/master/ROMs/ROM_Locations.txt 

-This should run fine on both physical hardware *and* MAME

Changes in this version:

1. ROM Names have changed in this release to have PCB locations instead of old 3 digit numbers. This 
   impacts MAME users as you must now ensure you have the current build of MAME from this site.
2. Fixed wrong sound on game boot (should be explosion instead of 'beep')
3. Pulled in Level 19 from Return to Vaxx for testing
4. Fixed animation for ship moving in Long Range Scanner so it moves incrementally up the screen.
5. Fixed issue where DIP switches were not being read in properly.
6. Removed some text on Alpha Test screen which should help it render better on actual hardware.

** Current issues are listed here - https://github.com/jessaskey/mhavocpe/issues
