Release notes for Major Havoc - The Promised End 
v0.14
4/23/2018

**For ROM locations see the document at https://github.com/jessaskey/mhavocpe/blob/master/ROMs/ROM_Locations.txt 

-This is a non-functional release, it runs in MAME but not on the actual hardware yet for some reason.

Changes in this version:

1. Removed 'Bonus 5000' from the Tube lauch screen
2. Re-Arranged a ton of code for making more space for Maze Object Data tables
3. I *think* I fixed the changing walls issue, I found a paging issue here in code.
4. I *think* I fixed the Trip Pads doing strange things too.
