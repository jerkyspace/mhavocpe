Release notes for Major Havoc - The Promised End 
v0.15
4/27/2018

**For ROM locations see the document at https://github.com/jessaskey/mhavocpe/blob/master/ROMs/ROM_Locations.txt 

-This should run fine on both physical hardware *and* MAME

Changes in this version:

1. Fixed Trip pads (tested on Level 8 at least)
2. Made it so Oxygen is awarded 32 counts per disc on Level 16. This should help Dave J. 
   determine if Level 16 can be finished on a single life without suffocating. What I
   actually did here was make the oxygen award variable depending on level (the default 
   was 16 units.
3. Added Oxygen Animation for fun
4. Fixed issues with Oxygen and Reactor timers not being shown.
5. Fixed breakout issue?
