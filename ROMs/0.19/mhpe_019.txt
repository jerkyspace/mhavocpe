Release notes for Major Havoc - The Promised End 
v0.19
07/22/2018

**For ROM locations see the document at https://github.com/jessaskey/mhavocpe/blob/master/ROMs/ROM_Locations.txt 

-This should run fine on both physical hardware *and* MAME

Changes in this version:

1. NOTE: This is the second release where the ROM Names have changed in this release to have PCB locations 
   instead of old 3 digit numbers. This impacts MAME users as you must now ensure you have the current *special*
   build of MAME from this site.
2. This version has a functional Star Castle level.. the downside is you have to get to level 25 in order to see 
   it. :-)  
3. Restored Atari copyright message.

** Current issues are listed here - https://github.com/jessaskey/mhavocpe/issues

KNOWN BUGS AS OF THIS RELEASE:

1. Space Maze Colors are messed up
2. No homeworld
3. Star Castle is mostly complete, still needs attention for sure.
4. Many unfished sections of new development
